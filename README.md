# contactscrapper

Develop a web-based app that can scrape business contacts from the Google search engine based on user-defined criteria. Instructions: Use JavaScript with React or Angular for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end. Implement a user interface for users to input their search criteria and parse the input to generate Boolean search queries. Use a headless browser to send the queries to Google and retrieve the search results pages.
Allow users to select which contacts to scrape and display the scraped data on the user interface. Instructions: Display the search results pages in the left-hand column of the user interface and allow users to select which contacts to scrape. For each selected contact, click on the link to the contact's LinkedIn profile and scrape the required data. Store the scraped data in the right-hand column of the user interface.
Implement anti-blocking techniques to avoid being flagged as a bot by Google. Instructions: Implement random delays between requests to mimic human behavior, use user-agent strings that mimic a human user, rotate IP addresses, and utilize headless browsing to simulate user interaction.
Save all output files in the appropriate directory. Instructions: Create a directory to store all output files and ensure that all scraped data is saved in the appropriate format and location.
Test the app thoroughly and provide a warranty period to fix any bugs that arise after the final payment. Instructions: Test the app regularly and provide updates to the client throughout the development process. Provide a warranty period to fix any bugs that arise after the final payment, and ensure that the app meets all requirements outlined in the specification document.
